### BreakCamalCase
Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.

```

### Build Tower
Build a pyramid-shaped tower, as an array/list of strings, given a positive integer number of floors. A tower block is represented with "*" character.

For example, a tower with 3 floors looks like this:
```
[
  "  *  ",
  " *** ", 
  "*****"
]
```
And a tower with 6 floors looks like this:
```
[
  "     *     ", 
  "    ***    ", 
  "   *****   ", 
  "  *******  ", 
  " ********* ", 
  "***********"
]
```

### Create Phone Number

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

Example
```
Kata.createPhoneNumber(new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0}) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"
```
The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.

Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!
